    "* You must have an AWS Account\n",

    "\n",
    "[Vaswani et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) introduced the world to transformer neural networks (originally for machine translation). Transformers ushered an era of generative AI with diffusion models for image creation and large language models (`LLMs`) as **programmable deep learning networks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming foundational LLMs is done with natural language – it doesn't require training/tuning like ML models of the past. This has opened the door to a massive amount of innovation and a paradigm shift in how technology can be deployed. The science/art of using natural language to program language models to accomplish a task is referred to as **Prompt Engineering**."

    "    * Best for privacy/security or if you already have a GPU.\n",
    "1. **Cloud hosting**: Using a cloud provider to deploy an instance that hosts a specific model. Ex. running Llama 2 on cloud providers like AWS, Azure, GCP, and others.\n",
    "    * Best for customizing models and their runtime (ex. fine-tuning a model for your use case).\n",
    "1. **Hosted API**: Call LLMs directly via an API. There are many companies that provide Llama 2 inference APIs including AWS Bedrock, Replicate, Anyscale, Together and others.\n",
    "    * Easiest option overall."

      "\n",
      "1. Transformers: Transformers are a type of neural network architecture that have revolutionized the field of NLP. They were introduced in a paper by Vaswani et al. in 2017 and have since become the standard architecture for many NLP tasks. Transformers are particularly well-suited for tasks that require long-range dependencies, such as machine translation and text generation.\n",
      "2. BERT and its variants: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a pre-trained language model that has achieved state-of-the-art results on many NLP tasks. BERT uses a multi-layer bidirectional transformer encoder to generate contextualized representations of words in a sentence. There have been many variants of BERT developed since its introduction, including RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and ALBERT.\n",
      "3. Long-range dependencies: One of the key challenges in NLP is modeling long-range dependencies, or the relationships between words that are far apart in a sentence. Recent advances in large language models have focused on improving the ability to model long-range dependencies, such as using attention mechanisms or incorporating external knowledge.\n",
      "4. Multitask learning: Many NLP tasks can be formulated as multitask learning problems, where a single model is trained on multiple tasks simultaneously. Recent advances in large language models have focused on developing models that can handle multiple tasks simultaneously, such as the Hydra model and the PolyModel model.\n",
      "5. Efficiency and scalability: As large language models become more widespread, there is a growing need for models that are efficient and scalable. Recent advances in hardware and software have made it possible to train and deploy large language models more efficiently, such as using GPUs or TPUs.\n",
